Today, we are proud to announce that we have taken the first baby steps to "give back" to the Open Source community by releasing the first version of ServiceModelContrib and ServiceModelContrib.IoC.Unity to [github](http://www.github.com/kredinor/ServiceModelContrib "ServiceModelContrib github repository") and the [Nuget repository](http://nuget.org/packages?q=ServiceModelContrib&sortOrder=package-download-count "Search for ServiceModelContrib on nuget.org").

If you use Microsoft Unity as your DI/IoC container and want to develop WCF-based services (or refine your existing ones), please check out the functionality in the latter package. A first, and brief description of the functionality can be found in the README in the github repository for both packages.

This is a subset of the functionality in our internal Kredinor.ServiceModel, and we will continue to add functionality to ServiceModelContrib and related sub packages.
