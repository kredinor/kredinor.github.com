# Welcome to Kredinor @ github

## Introduction

Since 1905, Kredinor have been providing debt-related administrative services to the Norwegian market, and is today one of the biggest debt collection agencies in Norway, with
~350 employees across eight offices in Norway. Our head quarters are located down town Oslo,
and holds the majority of the line of business unit as well as our strategic unit.

Since 2008, we have been on the path to reinventing how we do business. Our new platform is
based on Microsoft technology, and we use a vast array of products and components from Microsoft, other commercial third parties, open source and developed internally.

Through this site, we would like to give back to the open source community, by sharing
some of our internal frameworks and guidances.

The two topmost items on the list of things we would like to share, is Artifacts, our way of
organizing an artifact repository on top of Microsoft Team Foundation Server. The other one
is parts of Kredinor.ServiceModel, our helper library for developing robust, production-ready
services with WCF.
